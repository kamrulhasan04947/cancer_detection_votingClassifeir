        Abstract:
        This study employs machine learning methods to categorize tumor cells as benign or malignant cancer. The dataset used to contains various features related to tumor or cancer cell characteristics, with the goal of predicting the tumorâ€™s class accurately. The study applies supervised ensemble classification methods to train machine learning models on a dataset of 569 instances, each described by 32 features. The primary objective is to forecast whether a tumor is cancerous or benign with a significant amount of accuracy.
